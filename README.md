# Nutrition Analytics Dashboard: Vegetable Oil & Obesity

## 📘 Project Description
A data analytics and communication project analyzing the correlation between vegetable oil consumption and obesity prevalence across countries—leveraging Python for analysis and WordPress for interactive data presentation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To assess and communicate potential relationships between dietary fat consumption patterns (specifically vegetable oils) and obesity rates using real-world health and consumption data.

---

## 🧪 Methodology Overview
- Collected global data on vegetable oil consumption and obesity metrics
- Cleaned and processed datasets using Python (pandas, numpy)
- Conducted correlation and regression analyses
- Generated compelling data visualizations
- Embedded findings into a WordPress portal hosted on Apache
